<h4>Welcome, my name is Cadence Mitchell. I am the CEO and founder of FoudMyBattery.</h4>
<p>	This portfolio will serve as a platform to showcase my photography works. The examples provided may also show an idea of my style and creative vision. The primary purpose of this media set is to establish a solid online presence for collaboration and clientele. The curation of my work is to deliver an easily accessible format of my images ranging from landscape pieces to portraits and event related bookings. I would appreciate the building of my credibility as a seasoned photographer. This website is an extension of branding and generation of business opportunities. Whether that be colleagues or potential clients. The main goal of this media format would be clear navigation, a visually engaging layout, and versatility within the portfolio. My objectives are to reach a professional and commercial audience to push my services out. Ultimately, the portfolio website functions as both an artistic showcase and a professional tool for the growth of a career.</p>
