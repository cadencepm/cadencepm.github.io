    My name is Cadence Mitchell! I am a freshman, and I am an Electrical Engineering major. I am currently learning C programming. I have also dabbled in html coding before and have done a few small projects. I was in AP cs where I made numerous Scratch projects. My expectation for this course is to create a functioning website and to deepen my html knowledge. I hope to make my website even more complex after this course. My favorite hobbies are photography, art dance. All of those I have been doing for eleven years.
