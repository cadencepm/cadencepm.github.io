    <h3>Reflection, Goals, and Wishes</h3>
    <p id="para1">
        I was first handed a point and shoot camera at the age of seven. For the next decade or so I took pictures nonstop and my passion for photography bloomed. Around 2018 I got my camera. A Canon Rebel T6. It came with both short and long lenses. I became invested in my hobby. It was not until high school when I fell in love with posting my work. I worked nonstop to sort my images and specifically lay them out in the most pleasing way to be posted to Instagram. I began editing my pictures and learning the ropes of Adobe Lightroom. This continued until I had a revolutionary idea.

            My business idea began around a few years ago. I decided that because I was already pushing my work out on Instagram why not profit. I gathered individuals who wanted sessions. This was by far my biggest learning curve. I gained awareness of professional encounters, editing skills, sharing platforms, and managing schedules and profit balance. My hobby turned to a full-fledged learning experience and blossoming career. This career has now spanned for roughly a year and a half. I am now currently working on gaining an actual L.C.

            My goals for the future are to create a website to foster more clientele. I would like to separate my Instagram posts from professional matters. This is due to the Instagram page feeling informal. I plan to have all business inquiries regarded on the website only and to have the Instagram media as just a sneak peek into my work. For my website I plan to give a professional and clean feeling. I would like the site to be easily maneuvered, while showing off all aspects of what I have to offer. I would like to use this opportunity to expand my networking and coding skills as well. 
        </p>

            Overall, my career in photography has had its ups and downs. My passion of photography, along with my love for learning and exploring new adventures has led me to incredible opportunities. I have endured some rough learning curves but, I have strengthened many skills along the way and appreciate still having the ability to keep learning. I would enjoy exploring the future of making this website to add to my skillset. I would just hope to continue pushing this hobby into more than the small stage of business it is at currently using my previous skills, along with my future goals. Although this endeavor seems to be stalled at this moment, I can see amazing growth in the near future.
